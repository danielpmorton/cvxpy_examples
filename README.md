# CVXPY Examples

This repo was created to help teach `cvxpy` in AA203: Optimal and Learning-based Control

For the course website, see https://stanfordasl.github.io/aa203

More examples may be added in the future

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/danielpmorton/cvxpy_examples

pip install -e .
```

I recommend working inside a virtual environment. I'm using Python 3.10.8, for reference.
